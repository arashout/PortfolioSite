# arashout.site
This is the second iteration of my personal website.
It is heavily inspired by [Long Tran's website](http://ltran.co/)
Built with Jekyll, YAML and Bulma (CSS). 

## TODO:
- [ ] Add an aboutme or FAQ section
- [ ] Add headlines to each project, to sell them to the reader
    - Headline in resume.yaml
    - Subtitle in html
- [ ] Start doing some blog posts
- [ ] Link to raw pdf in github instead of using sub-repo
