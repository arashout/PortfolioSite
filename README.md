# arashout.site
This is the second iteration of my personal website.
It is heavily inspired by [Long Tran's website](http://ltran.co/) which honestly still much better than mine. 
Built with Jekyll, YAML and Bulma (CSS). 

## TODO:
- Gif support for each project [ ]
    - Gif tag in resume.yaml [ ]
    - Gif viewer on click on the site [ ]
- Add all projects to the site [ ]
    - Possibly split up projects in terms of size or duration?
- Add an aboutme or FAQ section [ ]
- Add extra-curricular section for UBC Baja [ ]
