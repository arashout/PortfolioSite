# arashout.site
This is the second iteration of my personal website.
It is heavily inspired by [Long Tran's website](http://ltran.co/) which honestly still much better than mine. 
Built with Jekyll, YAML and Bulma (CSS). 

## TODO:
- [ ] Gif support for each project
    - Gif tag in resume.yaml
    - Gif viewer on click on the site
- [ ] Add all projects to the site
    - Possibly split up projects in terms of size or duration?
- [ ] Add an aboutme or FAQ section
- [ ] Add extra-curricular section for UBC Baja
- [ ] Add headlines to each project, to sell them to the reader
    - Headline in resume.yaml
    - Subtitle in html
