            <p>
                Our team built a rc tank with a electromagnetic sensor capble of detecting metal buried underneath the sand. With a 22.5 gear ratio the tank was able climb inclines up to 40 degrees. Unfortunately during the competition our 3d printed gears stripped so we didn't perform too hot.<br> That's okay though, because we learned a lot during this competition and did much better on the next one.<br> For this project I was mainly in charge of designing the drive train, creating the CAD models.
