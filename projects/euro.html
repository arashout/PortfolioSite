        <h3>EURO Project</h3>
        <p>
            A water propelled RC car with valve control and ackermann steering geometry
            to prevent slippage on slippery and wet race track.<br>
            This second engineering design competition was unique because you were also
            graded on how well you thought your vechicle would perform through different
            events.<br>
            Our team did awesome, we scored most of our points in the maneuverability events
            and predictions.<br>
            In this project I primarily in charge of developing the MATLAB simulation used to
            predict our performance, building the modular chassis, developing and implementing the
            steering.
