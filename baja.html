            <p>
                UBC Baja is a student-run engineering design team focused on designing, building and racing an off-road vehicle. As a member, I got hands on experience with several different facets of the design process. Here are some of my note worthy projects:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Conducted failure analysis on rear half-shafts of our vehicle which were twisting due high torsion forces during deceleration. I was able to increase the yield strength by 2x at little cost because I acquired a sponsership from Golden Gear worth $400 to spline our new half-shafts for <strike>free</strike> a couple of beers!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I developed a CAD model of our custom Polaris Gearbox using SolidWorks that allows us to play around with different drive-train packaging ideas (How we arrange drive train components).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During my first year on the team, I did a lot of miscellaneous machining tasks based off engineering drawings. One of my biggest machining jobs was to turn dozens of suspension inserts on the lathe
                    </li>
                </ul>
