INTRO:

This is my super simple personal website. It perfectly illustrates why I won't become a star UX/UI designer but here's some things I am good at:
-Automating things, I hate seeing smart people waste their time doing repetitive menial tasks. So I have made it my lifes mention to automate these tasks.
I have become very good at it, my usual tools of choice are Selenium, Python, VBA (For Microsoft Office + SAP), and Autohotkey
-CADing things, the quintissental mechanical engineering student skill. I have had lots of practice transforming imagination into <strike>reality</strike> virtual reality

What I'm working on:
-Solving Math/Physics problems programmitically
-Data science and Machine learning
-Lower level programming knowledge
-Lots of MOOOOCS
