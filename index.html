            <h3>
                Hey I'm a mechanical engineering student who loves to program...
            </h3>
            <div>
                But I'm also good at some other things like:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>CADing</strong>, the quintessential mechanical engineering skill. </p>
                        <p>I've had lots of practice over the course of my degree 
                        transforming designs in mind into tangilbe 3D models ready
                        to be printed or machined.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Automation</strong>, I believe that we shouldn't waste human potential on reptitive tasks. We're too smart for that.</p>
                        <p>
                            So I have made it my lifes mission to automate any menial process I encounter in an attempt to improve the well-being and sanity of those around me.
                            The tools I use to achieve this vary on the task at hand, in the past I've used Python, Selenium, VBA and Autohotkey.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Web Development</strong>, obviously I'm not a full stack developer, yet...</p>
                        <p>
                            But I've grown pretty fond of using simple HTML, CSS, Javascript to build my projects that
                            I can share with the world. In general, I aim for simple and functional as opposed to anything flashy,
                            this website being a perfect example.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
