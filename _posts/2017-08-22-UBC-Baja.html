UBC Baja is a student-run engineering design team focused on designing, building and racing an off-road vehicle. As a member,
I got hands on experience with several different facets of the design process. Here are some of my note worthy
projects:
<ul>
    <li>
        Conducted failure analysis on rear half-shafts of our vehicle which were twisting due high torsion forces during deceleration.
        I was able to increase the yield strength by 2x at little cost because I acquired a sponsership from
        Golden Gear worth $400 to spline our new half-shafts for
        <strike>free</strike> a couple of beers!
    </li>
    <li>
        I developed a CAD model of our custom Polaris Gearbox using SolidWorks that allows us to play around with different drive-train
        packaging ideas (How we arrange drive train components).
    </li>
    <li>
        During my first year on the team, I did a lot of miscellaneous machining tasks based off engineering drawings. One of my
        biggest machining jobs was to turn dozens of suspension inserts on the lathe
    </li>
