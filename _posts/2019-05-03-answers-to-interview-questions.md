## Tell me about yourself
I just graduated from UBC with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. `How can sell this?`     
Previously, during a gap year I worked as software engineer building
Ravelin's customer facing dashboard using AngularJS and Go micro-services.     
Before that at my past internships I automated manual processes using VBA and Python
which endeared me to my co-workers and the positive feedback encouraged to pursue programming as a career.  
Currently, I'm particularly interested in breaking into the dotnet ecosystem and to understand lower level
programming concepts while learning Rust.

## Strengths
Not being afraid to ask questions. `expand`

## Weaknesses
Not being a traditional CS student potentially put me behind the curve in some areas.
However, I've made it a focus to address any of these deficincies and to continually
be improving and learning more.

## Why do you want to work here?
A couple of reasons:
- As I mentioned I am interested in breaking into the dotnet eco-system
- The work
