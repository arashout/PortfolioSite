# Why Though
Someone recently contacted me regarding an old Reddit post I had made about finding a software engineering job without a formal computer science degree
They saw that I was working in software now and basically asked if I had advice for them to do the same.

# Who I Am
TODO:

**So here is my advice about breaking into a CS (computer science) career without a CS degree.**
In point-form because I'm not a good writer (yet?). 
Hopefully this is useful to anyone else thinking of making the switch.

# Caveats
Before I begin dispensing sagely advice, I should probably expand on my personal circumstances which had massive impact on my decision making process, feel free to skip this section if you either already know my life story üòç or don't care üò¢:
- I was pretty young at the time (22 years old) with plenty of free time
- Lived with my parents
    - Which basically meant I had no responsibilities
    - Also a safety net, so if things didn't work out I didn't have to worry about ending up on the street
    - And I could afford to take a smaller salary
- I was in the midst of finishing a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) degree.
    - Although, having worked in the industry I don't really think this is required, especially if you apply to start-ups which are more willing to take a chance. 
    - However I think it is likely that a Bachelors degree will help you especially when apply to less progressive big "Corp" companies
Much of this advice is still applicable to others with different circumstances, but it's important to have an idea where I'm coming from.

# Advice

## Why second Bachelors Degree in CS
Even though this post is about getting a job without a CS degree, It's worthwhile to discuss #TODO: Transition
