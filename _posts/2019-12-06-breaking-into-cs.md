# Why Though
Someone recently contacted me regarding an old Reddit post I had made about finding a software engineering with a
mechanical engineering degree.
They saw that I was working in software now and basically asked if I had advice for them to do the same.


So here is my advice about breaking into a CS (computer science) career without a CS degree.
In point-form because I'm not a good writer obviously. 
Here is to hoping it helps someone else who was frustrated like me a couple years ago.

# Caveats
Before I begin dispensing sagely advice, I should probably expand on my personal circumstances which had massive impact on my decision making process, feel free to skip this section if you either already know my life story üòç or don't care üò¢ :
## I guess I can kind of program
I was relatively confident in my programming abilities, or at the very least the ability to figure out concepts that I didn't know on the job.
As much as new graduate who has never been on a actual software project can be anyway.
## I like to write code
If you are trying to break into the CS industry you probably like programming as well, but it's important to not only enjoy the building new things but to also be able to at-least tolerant the less sexy parts of the job like:
- Refactoring old/ugly code
- Spending a long time setting up your environment to run a program
- Spending even longer debugging the program
- Working with other people (I don't consider this a downside but some people do, because it breaks the stereotype of the lone-wolf genius hacker)
    - Many of whom are way smarter then you
- Sitting in meetings discussing the ramifications of every action
- Having to work on programs/code you don't particularly care about
## Pretty young
## Lived with my parents
## Tired of school
At point 

## Shouldn't I get a second bachelors degree in CS?
