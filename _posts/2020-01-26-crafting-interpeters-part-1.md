# Intro
I recently found out about an [online book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) being written by Bob Nystrom from hacker news.     
     

Ever since I started working with [TypeScript](), it opened my eyes to how a well crafted programming language can significantly improve the developing experience and production 
of a engineer. From that point on, I had a lurking fascination with how programming languages are compiled/transpiled/interpreted.    
    
Anyway the online book looks really promising, it has great explanations without being too wordy, it has additional exercises at the end of each chapter and the website design is really great.    
That's why I'll be working through the book and to keep myself accountable I'll be sharing my progress here.     
Furthermore, to make sure I'm actually understanding the code posted inside the book and not just copy and pasting I'll be building the interpreter using [Rust]().
